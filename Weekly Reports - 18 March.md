## Weekly Report

Sunday, 18 March 2018

I'm studying Git, Github, Jupyter, Markdown and Latex this past weeks.
I'm hoping that I could be better at making digital notes by learning all of those things. Hopefully those things would help me in arranging my works in the future.

I'm learning it right now, so that in the future it'll just be easier for me to digitalize my works, sharing it with others, and also I want to discover power in these tools.

Here's an overview about what I have learned in the past few weeks.

#### Git & Github

This past week I studied Git & Github from [Udacity YT](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAwxTw4SYaPk8_-6IGxJtD3i2QAu5_s_p) and also from New Boston that I downloaded all of his playlist at [Boston YT](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGAKWClAD_iKpNC0bGHxGhcx) 

I must say that it was a good experience!

I've read things about how powerful Git as a _version control_ system is. And how Github has been _a platform for sharing and working together on projects_ with all different people. Someone on Medium also posts something about **Data Scientist need to learn Git to version control their projects** and that's the first step towards me learning Git and Github

I've just gone through the videos and make some notes. Maybe I'll write it up in different documents and link it all here.

#### Jupyter Notebooks

Jupyter was something that I've tried to learn in the past. I think it's around September or October when I've first trying Jupyter and also installing Anaconda for the purpose of learning Python and documenting the journey. 

But, I stopped mid-way because I've got college task to complete and I'm writing it in C++, so I think I'll dig into Python later.

But, right now I'm here though, and not for learning Python, I've done that (now much though) and ended up not documenting it. Right now, my goal of is using Jupyter notebook **to make a digitalized math's notes** 

Yes, I could've used it offline, but I'm still on the goal of documenting my journey -- that's it.

I'm now fairly good at navigating the Jupyter (I think). I've read several issues on Github relating to Jupyter and found myself learning Jupyter as an easy and amazing experience.

I'm planning to go further deep and see how I could manifest power from Jupyter.

Several notes I've read:
1. [Datacamp's Tutorial](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/tutorial-jupyter-notebook)
-- Good ones. Comprehensive and could be useful for future references
2. [Managing the Kernels](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jupyter/notebook/blob/master/docs/source/examples/Notebook/Running%20Code.ipynb#Managing-the-Kernel)
-- I just read that
3. [Really great user-manual](https://jupyter.brynmawr.edu/services/public/dblank/Jupyter%20Notebook%20Users%20Manual.ipynb)
4. [Interesting parts about Links](https://jupyter.brynmawr.edu/services/public/dblank/Jupyter%20Notebook%20Users%20Manual.ipynb#4.3-Hyperlinks "Jupyter Notebook Manual")
-- Future references

That's I think what I'm capable of this past week. I'm digging into some stuff like interactive dashboards, good practice for data science, and collection of interesting Jupyter notebooks

- [Jupyter for DS Best Practice](https://www.svds.com/tbt-jupyter-notebook-best-practices-data-science/)
- [Interactive Dashboards](https://blog.dominodatalab.com/interactive-dashboards-in-jupyter/)
- [Gallery of Interesting Notebooks](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-Jupyter-Notebooks)

#### Markdown

Markdown is literally what I used for creating this document. 

I'm practically reading the markdown's tutorial in the user manual that I've referenced before. And practicing it live as I'm writing this.

So, several articles I've read

1. [The Basics](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics)
2. [A Better Overview](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)

I think I'm getting the hang of it after reading and practicing. I think I'll become fluent fast. So, no problem here.

#### Latex

Here's the interesting part about all of my activities up until now. 

I've only read about Latex in here [Interesting Latex Formulas](https://jupyter.brynmawr.edu/services/public/dblank/Jupyter%20Notebook%20Users%20Manual.ipynb#4.9-LaTeX-Math) and I think the learning step would be somewhat thrilling. Hopefully I could get some notes on this.

I'm learning Latex through 

1. [The Not So Short Intro to Latex](https://tobi.oetiker.ch/lshort/lshort.pdf "PDF File")
2. [Random Sites](http://latex.knobs-dials.com/)

So, that's this weeks report. It's around 11 A.M now and I've got so much time to study. So, signing out.
